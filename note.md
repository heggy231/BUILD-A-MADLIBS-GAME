Our mission for 1st lesson:
  1) New data type: arrays
  2) Count in JS
  3) Translating JS into HTML

- Mad Lib is a word substitution game that uses parts of speech
  ex) Give me a Noun! < Panda Bear!
  Give me a Verb! < Poop!

  * Josh asked Debbie on a "panda bear" to go "poop" with him.

  * Josh asked Debbie on a "chair" to go "bounce" with him.

  * Our JS Mad Lib will ask the user one question, and then after they answer it, a brand new question will appear on screen as if by magic!

- Mad Lib, we can either have many individual variables, OR try hold a bunch of different pieces of information in one fancy value.  Such as data type arrays.
  var array = [ thing1, thing2, thing3 ];

// List of prompts for the user
var prompts = [
  'Type your name',
  'Type an adjective',
  'Type a noun'
];

prompts variable contains an array; array
